# Guess the Number 🎯

A simple Python console game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number.

---

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

- The computer randomly chooses a number between **1 and 100**
- The player keeps guessing until they find the correct number
- After each guess, the game gives a hint:
  - **Too high**
  - **Too low**
- The game ends when the correct number is guessed

---

## 🧠 Rules

- You must enter a number between **1 and 100**
- If you enter something that is not a number, the game will warn you
- The game continues until you guess correctly
